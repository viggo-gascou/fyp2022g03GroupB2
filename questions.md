# Questions

- How do we properly measure perplexity?



- Should we train 5 different models for the 5 stances, or one for all of them?

Train a model on one topic. For testing, run it on all the other topics.

- Do we need to split the training dataset, since there already is a training/
  validation/test split.

The preset splits are fine.
